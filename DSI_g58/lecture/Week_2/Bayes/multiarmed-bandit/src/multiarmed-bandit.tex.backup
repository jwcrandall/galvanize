 \item can stop a test early based on surprising data
\end{itemize}

\section{Priors}
\subsection{}

\frametitle{Lets talk about priors}
\footnotesize

\begin{block}{Subjective vs Objective priors}
Bayesian priors can be classified into two classes: \keywd{objective priors}, 
which aim to allow the data to influence the posterior the most, and 
\keywd{subjective priors}, which allow the practitioner to express his or her 
views into the prior.
\end{block}

\begin{itemize}
 \item If we added more probability mass to certain areas of 
the prior, and less elsewhere, we are biasing our inference towards the 
unknowns 
existing in the former area.
\item The prior's influence changes as our dataset increases
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{
\begin{block}{Empirical Bayes}
It is not a true Bayesian method. Empirical Bayes combines frequentist and 
Bayesian inference.  The prior distribution, instead of being selected 
beforehand is estimated directly from the data generally with frequentist 
methods.
\end{block}
\vspace{0.5cm}

\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{block}{CAUTION}
 Many people feel that empirical bayes is \textit{double counting} or 
\textit{double dipping} from the data
\end{block}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{
\frametitle{The Gamma distribution}
\scriptsize
A Gamma random variable, denoted $X \sim \text{Gamma}(\alpha, \beta)$, is 
also

\begin{equation}
\text{Exp}(\beta) \sim \text{Gamma}(1, \beta)
\end{equation}

The additional parameter gives flexibility which helps us better express
subjective priors. The density function for a $\text{Gamma}(\alpha, \beta)$ 
random variable is:

\begin{equation}
f(x \mid \alpha, \beta) = \frac{\beta^{\alpha}x^{\alpha-1}e^{-\beta 
x}}{\Gamma(\alpha)} 
\end{equation}

where $\Gamma(\alpha)$ is the 
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma\_function)}{Gamma 
function}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{
\frametitle{The Beta distribution}
\footnotesize

The Beta distribution is very useful in Bayesian statistics. A random variable 
$X$ has a $\text{Beta}$ distribution, with parameters $(\alpha, \beta)$, if its 
density function is:

\begin{equation}
f_X(x | \; \alpha, \beta ) = \frac{ x^{(\alpha - 1)}(1-x)^{ (\beta - 1) } 
}{B(\alpha, \beta) }
\end{equation}

where $B$ is the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta\_function}{Beta 
function} (hence the name). The random variable $X$ is only allowed in [0,1], 
making the Beta distribution a popular distribution for decimal values, 
probabilities and proportions. The values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$, both positive 
values, provide great flexibility in the shape of the distribution.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{
\frametitle{So what?}
\footnotesize
There is an interesting connection between the Beta distribution and the 
Binomial distribution. Suppose we are interested in some unknown proportion or 
probability $p$. (think of coin example)
\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{itemize}
 \item We assign a $\text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)$ prior to $p$. We observe some 
data generated by a Binomial process, say $X \sim \text{Binomial}(N, p)$, with 
$p$ still unknown. 

\item Then our posterior \textit{is again a Beta distribution}, i.e. $p | X 
\sim \text{Beta}( \alpha + X, \beta + N -X )$. 

\item If we start with a $\text{Beta}(1,1)$ prior on $p$ (which is a Uniform), 
observe data $X \sim \text{Binomial}(N, p)$, then our posterior is 
$\text{Beta}(1 + X, 1 + N - X)$. 
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.5cm}
\highlt{A Beta prior with Binomial observations creates a Beta 
posterior}. This is a very useful property, both computationally and 
heuristically.

\frametitle{Beta conjugate to the binomial proof}
If you are curious how we can identify a conjugate prior you can follow the proof (5 minutes).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{   
\frametitle{Conjugate priors}
\footnotesize

Recall that

\begin{equation}
P(y|\theta) \propto p(\theta|y) p(\theta)
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Conjugate families of priors arise when the likelihood times the prior 
produces a recognizable posterior kernel
 \item For mathematical convenience, we construct a family of prior densities 
that lead to simple posterior densities.
 \item Conjugate prior distributions have the practical advantage, in addition 
to computational
convenience, of being interpretable as additional data
 \item Probability distributions that belong to an 
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_family}{exponential family} 
have natural conjugate prior distributions

\begin{block}{Multi-armed bandit}
Suppose you are faced with $N$ slot machines. Each bandit has an unknown 
probability of distributing a prize (assume for now the prizes are the same for 
each bandit, only the probabilities differ). Some bandits are very generous, 
others not so much. Of course, you don't know what these probabilities are. By 
only choosing one bandit per round, our task is devise a strategy to maximize 
our winnings.
\end{block}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{
\frametitle{The bandits problem}
\scriptsize
\begin{itemize}
 \item If we knew the bandit with the largest probability, then always picking 
this bandit would yield the maximum winnings. So our task can be phrased as 
\highlt{Find the best bandit, and as quickly as possible}. 

\item The task is complicated by the stochastic nature of the bandits. A 
suboptimal bandit can return many winnings, purely by chance, which would make 
us believe that it is a very profitable bandit. Similarly, the best bandit can 
return many duds. Should we keep trying losers then, or give up? 

\item A more troublesome problem is, if we have found a bandit that returns 
\textit{pretty good} results, do we keep drawing from it to maintain our 
\textit{pretty good score}, or do we try other bandits in hopes of finding an 
\textit{even-better} bandit? This is the \highlt{exploration} vs. 
\highlt{exploitation} dilemma.
\end{itemize}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{ 
\frametitle{Exploration vs Exploitation}
\begin{itemize}
\item \keywd{Exploration}: Trying out different options to try and determine
the reward associated with the given approach (i.e. acquiring
more knowledge)
\ \\ \
\item \keywd{Exploitation}: Going with the approach that you believe to
have the highest expected payoff (i.e. optimizing decisions
based on existing knowledge)
\end{itemize}

sales? Naturally minimizing strategies that do not work (generalizes to A/B/C/D 
strategies)
 \item \highlt{Ecology}: How do the animals maximize its fitness w.r.t energy?
  \item \highlt{Finance}: which stock option gives the highest return, under 
time-varying return profiles.
  \item \highlt{Clinical trials}: a researcher would like to find the best 
treatment, out of many possible treatment, while minimizing losses. 
  \item \highlt{Psychology}: How does punishment and reward affect our 
behaviour? How do humans learn?
\end{itemize}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{ 
\frametitle{Traditional A/B testing}

The process
\begin{itemize}
\item Start with pure exploration in which groups A and B are
assigned equal number of users
\item Once you think you have determined the better option, switch
to pure exploitation in which you stop the experiment and send
all users to the better performer
\end{itemize}

Potential issues
\begin{itemize}
 \item Equal number of observations are routed to A and B for a
preset amount of time or iterations
 \item Only after that preset amount of time or iterations do we stop
and use the better performer
 \item Waste time (and money!) showing users the site that isnâ€™t
performing as well
\end{itemize}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{
\frametitle{Multi-armed bandit solutions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Shows a user the site that you think is best most of the time
(exactly how is dictated by the strategy chosen)
\item As the experiment runs, we update the belief about the true
CTR (Click Through Rate)
\item Run for however long until we are satisfied the experiment has
determined the better site
\item Balances exploration and exploitation rather than doing only
one or the other
\end{itemize}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{
\frametitle{formalization}
\begin{itemize}
\item The model is given by a set of real distributions $B = {R_{1}, ..., 
R_{K}}$,
\item where each distribution is associated with the a reward delivered by
one of the $K \in N$ + levers.
\item We will let $\mu_{1}, ... , \mu_{K}$ be the mean values associated with 
these reward distributions.
\item The gambler plays one lever per round and observes the associated
reward. 
\item The goal is to maximize the sum of the collective rewards,
or alternatively minimize the agentâ€™s \keywd{regret}
\end{itemize}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{
\frametitle{Regret}
\begin{block}{}
The regret $p$ that an agent experiences after $T$ rounds is the
difference between the reward sum associated with an optimal
strategy and the sum of collected rewards
\end{block}

\begin{equation}
p = T \mu^{*} - \sum^{T}_{t=1} \hat{r}_{t}
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
 \item $\mu^{*}$ - is the maximal reward mean, $\mu^{*} = max_{k}\{\mu_{k}\}$
 \item $\hat{r}_{t}$ - is the reward at time t
 \item \keywd{Regret} is simply a measure of how often you choose a suboptimal 
bandit. We can think of this as the cost function we are trying to minimize
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{
\frametitle{A zero-regret strategy}

\begin{itemize}
 \item A zero-regret strategy is a strategy whose average regret per
round p/T tends to zero when the number of rounds played
tends toward infinity
 \item Interestingly enough, a zero-regret strategy does not guarantee
you will never choose a sub-optimal outcome, but rather
guarantees that, over time, you will tend to choose the optimal
outcome
\end{itemize}

based on the result.

\subsection{}

\frame{
\frametitle{Bayesian Bandits}
The Bayesian bandit algorithm involves modeling each of our bandits
with a beta distribution with the following shape parameters:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\alpha$ = 1 + number of times bandit has won
 \item $\beta$ = 1 + number of times bandit has lost
\end{itemize}

We will then take a random sample from each banditâ€™s distribution
and choose the bandit with the highest value.
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{
\frametitle{Bayesian Bandits}
\scriptsize
\begin{block}{} 
There are also many approximately-optimal solutions which are quite 
good. One of the few solutions that can scale incredibly well. The solution is 
known as \keywd{Bayesian Bandits}.
\end{block}
\vspace{1cm}
These strategies are an example of \keywd{online algorithms} because they are 
continuously-being-updated, aka \keywd{reinforcement 
learning algorithm}. The algorithm starts in an ignorant state, where it knows 
nothing, and begins to acquire data by testing the system. As it acquires data 
and results, it learns what the best and worst behaviors are (in this case, it 
learns which bandit is the best).
}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{
\begin{itemize}
 \item Like in a normal multi-arm problem, an agent must choose
between arms during each iteration
 \item Before making the choice, the agent sees a d-dimensional
feature vector (context vector), associated with the current
iterations state
 \item The agent uses the context vector as well as the history of past
rewards to choose the arm to play in the current iteration
 \item Over time, the aim is for the agent to learn how the context
vectors relate to the associated rewards so as to pick the
optimal arm
\end{itemize}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{
\frametitle{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
\item The problem originated with a gambler standing in front of a
row of slot machines (referred to as \textit{one-armed bandits})
\item The agent has to decide which machines to play, how many
times to play each machine, and it which order
\item Each bandit will provide a reward from a unknown distribution
\item Objective is to maximize the sum of rewards earned through a
series of lever pulls
\item There are several classes of fairly optimal solutions

% \keywd{MCMC}
% \begin{itemize}
%  \item It is an family of algorithms for obtaining a sequence of random samples from a probability distribution for which direct sampling is difficult.

%  \item It allows for inference on complex models
% \end{itemize}
% 
% A particularly useful class of MCMC, known as Hamliltonian Monte Carlo, requires \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient}{gradient} information which is often not readily available so PyMC3 uses Theano to get around this problem.  Something that has recently made this whole field a lot more interesting is the No-U-turn sampler (NUTS) because there are \highlt{self-tuning strategies} \citep{Hoffman14}.

% There are numerous types of recommender systems
% \begin{itemize}
%  \item \keywd{Popularity} - Most viewed, most well-liked, not customized to users
%  \item \keywd{User-User} - Recommend items liked by users with similar results
%  \item \keywd{Item-Item} - Recommend items similar to what the current user rated favorably
%  \item \keywd{Matrix-Factorization} - Estimate a users underlying preferences
% \end{itemize}
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\
% Two of the most commonly implemented varieties are:
% \begin{itemize}
%  \item \keywd{collaborative filtering} - Imagine that user 1 and user 2 both like the same 4 science fiction novels we can then infer that if user 1 also likes another similar novel then user 2 will have a good chance of also liking it.
%  \item \keywd{Content-based recommender} - These systems also make use of extra features associated with the user

%  \item Probabilistic approach to the collaborative filtering problem that takes a Bayesian perspective \citep{Salakhutdinov08}.
%  \item The ratings $R$ are modeled as draws from a Gaussian distribution
%  \item We use precision $\alpha$, a fixed parameter, that reflects the uncertainty of the estimations; the normal distribution is commonly reparameterized in terms of precision, which is the inverse of the variance.
%  \item small precision parameters help control the growth of our latent parameters
%  \end{itemize}

% \frametitle{Conclusions}
% \footnotesize
% \begin{itemize}
%  \item Our results demonstrate that the mean of means method is our best baseline on our prediction task. 
%  \item We are able to obtain a significant decrease in RMSE using the PMF MAP estimate obtained via Powell optimization. 
%  \item We illustrated one way to monitor convergence of an MCMC sampler with a high-dimensionality sampling space 
%  \item The traceplots using this method seem to indicate that our sampler converged to the posterior.
%  \item Results using this posterior showed that attempting to improve the MAP estimation using MCMC sampling actually overfit the training data and increased test RMSE. This was likely caused by the constraining of the posterior via fixed precision parameters $\alpha$, $\alpha U$ and $\alpha V$.

% \frametitle{Another take on probabilistic programming}
% \footnotesize
% \begin{block}{}
%  Another way of thinking about this: unlike a traditional program, which only runs in the forward directions, \highlt{a probabilistic program is run in both the forward and backward direction}. It runs forward to compute the consequences of the assumptions it contains about the world (i.e., the model space it represents), but it also runs backward from the data to constrain the possible explanations. In practice, many probabilistic programming systems will cleverly interleave these forward and backward operations to efficiently home in on the best explanations.
