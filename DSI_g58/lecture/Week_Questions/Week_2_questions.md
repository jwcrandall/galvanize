## Week 2 Review Questions

1) What is Bayes rule?  What does it relate?

2) How many ways can I arrange n unique objects?  Formula?  

3) How many ways can I arrange k of n unique objects, where k < n?  What is this called? Formula?

4) If order doesn't matter, how many ways can I pick of n objects? What is this called? Formula?

5) What distribution would you use in the following cases:  
  * What is the probability that the mean volume of 50 bottles is less than 500 ml?
  * Deciding to go for a run or not.
  * Determining how many days pass before you finally decide to go for a run.  
  * Determining how likely it is that you go for 10 runs in a month.
  * Calculating how much water falls into an open swimming pool during a rain storm.
  * Assuming you run at a 9 minute mile pace avg pace, determining how likely it is that you pass the 3 mile mark in a race in 25 minutes?  

6) What is the central limit theorem?  

7) How would you go about implementing a bootstrap, and why would you do it?  

8) Conceptual - Studies of American health habits often show that urban dwellers have lower average body mass index (BMI)s and are less likely to be obese than people who live in other types of locations. A naive scientist would conclude that living in cities causes people to be thinner.
Discuss at least two confounding variables and how you might change your sampling parameters to mitigate these effects.  

9) I surveyed 200 people and looked at their average expenditure on coffee/tea by season. I found that the mean coffee expenditure in winter was greater than that in the summer, with a p-value of .02. Is this significant? Why or why not? What significance level would convince you?

10) What are the four factors that influence statistical power?

11) Draw the distributions associated with a hypothesis test between two means.  Label the critical value, the Type I error, and Type II error.  Indicate on the diagram how you'd calculate the statistical power.
