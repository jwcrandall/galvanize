## Week 1 Review Questions

1. Compare and contrast functional and object oriented programming paradigms.  Then discuss the the 3 pillars of OOP and how they relate to Python.

2. What are some distinguishing characteristics of the Python programming
language?

3. What are some differences between Python 2 and Python 3?  Why was Python 3
developed?

4. List major data structures in Python.  Which data structure(s) would you use to
in each of the following situations, and why:

  * Unchanging sales records

  * A customer database where changing information, such as address, email,
  and purchases are associated with a given customer name.

  * Driving waypoint locations between arbitrary points A and B.

  * The unique words used in a text corpus.

  * A search engine that returns results quickly for a given search term.

5. Write a one line list comprehension to perform the following matrix
multiplication (A dot product B).  Describe how it works. How would you check
it with NumPy?
```python
    A = [ [ 2, 4], [ 1, 7], [-1, 8] ]

    B = [ [3, 2, -5, 6],  [1, -3, 4, 8] ]
```

6. Estimate the run-time complexity (O(N) notation) of the following code:
  ```python
  def find_duplicates(l1, l2):
    '''
    searches through lists 1 and 2 and eliminates duplicate entries from list 2
    '''
    for item1 in l1:
      for item2 in l2:
        if item2 == item1:
          # removes item from list
          l2.remove(item2)
    return l1, l2
  ```
  Write another function with the same functionality that works more efficiently. Use timeit to see how well you can do!

  (Hint: you could use something like
  ```np.random.randint(0, 100, 50)```
  to create random lists to practice with)

7. Use datatable 'customers' (example rows below), write a SQL query to....

| cust_id | cust_name | current_city | hometown |
|:----------:|:------------:|:----------:|:-----------:|
| 1 | Amanda | Atlanta | Raleigh |
| 2 | Brittany | Denver | New York |
| 3 | Charles | Paris | Raleigh |
| 4 | David | San Diego | Los Angeles |
| 5 | Elizabeth | Atlanta | London |
| 6 | Greg | Denver | Atlanta |
| 7 | Maria | Raleigh | New York |
| 8 | Sarah | New York | Raleigh |
| 9 | Thomas | Atlanta | Raleigh |

  **Assume that everyone has moved**

  A) Return the city with the highest population growth. (Highest net of people who currently live there minus people who used to live there)

  B) Return pairs of "friends" (can be two columns or a tuple) that have both the same hometown and current city. Remove duplicates!
