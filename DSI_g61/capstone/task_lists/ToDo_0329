Task List
March 29

Overall Plan:
- (1 day) Clean Data
- (1 day) Produce Graph
- (3 days) Analyze Network
- (2 days) Visualization
- (2 days) Background research  (i.e. Who are these people?)

Yesterday: Clean data
- Read the edge list and convert it to network
- Read node lists
- Combine the node lists into one dataframe
- Do some cleanup of names
- Ensure that all "Bearers" do not become a single node
- We only want to look at Saudi Arabia and, maybe, Jordan
- Created subgroup for SA and JOR and relabel them.

Today: visualization
- Gephi
- NetworkX
- Force Atlas 2 (is it better?)
- (maybe) Modularity + analysis of results

Tomorrow:
- Modularity to identify communities
Make figures for...
- Centrality measurements
- Page Rank
- Degree
- Eignevectors

Journal:
- Went down rabbit-whole making functions that analysis network
- having issue with gephi's memory
- may want to rewrite code to be more functional so it will stop breaking and, thus,
improve work flow.
- May need to think about normalizing my edges...not sure
- May need to do more EDA at some point.
- Functionalize code: clean, import, graph, and Methods
- Create function for all unique company types
