# Write a script that prompts the user to input numbers separated by commas.
user_str = input("Please enter numbers separated by commas: ")
# Your script will then take these inputted numbers and store them as a list of tuples,
# two at a time.
user_num = user_str.split(',')
user_num = [int(element.strip()) for element in user_num]
print(zip(user_num[::2], user_num[1::2]))

# foo = dict()
# bar = tuple(foo.items())

# Finally, your script will print that list of tuples to the user.

# If the user inputs an odd number of numbers,
# then only make a list of the largest number of pairs of two that are possible.
